                    <p>By using this Site, and further by registering to use our Service, you ("You, Your or Yourself") agree that you are at least 18 years of age and are agreeing to accept and comply with the terms and conditions of use stated below ("Terms of Use"). You should read the entire Terms of Use carefully before you use this web site ("Site") or any of the services of this Site. As used herein, "Localcoinbox" refers to the Company, including without limitation thereby, its owners, directors, investors, employees or other related parties. Depending upon context, "Localcoinbox" may also refer to the services, products, Site, content or other materials (collectively, "Materials") provided by Localcoinbox. The Service operated by Localcoinbox allows buyers ("Buyers") and sellers ("Sellers"), to buy and sell the Internet currency known as "Bitcoins".</P>
                        
                        <p>The Service operated by Localcoinbox also allows all registered users of the Service ("Members") to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transfer Bitcoins to you or other Members or other users of Bitcoin outside the Localcoinbox site.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Depending on Your country of residence. It is your responsibility to follow those rules and laws in Your country of residence and/or country from which You access this Site and Services. As long as you agree to and actually comply with these Terms of Use, Localcoinbox grants to you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and limited right to enter and use the Site and the Service. </p>
                            <br>
                    <h3>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF USE AND CONDITIONS OUTLINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCESS THIS SITE AND DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.</h3>
                    <p>The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency - virtual or not - may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.</p>
                    
                    <p>Bitcoin trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Bitcoin is a unique kind of "fiat" currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of Bitcoins in a crisis or issue more currency. </p>
                    
                    <p>Instead, Bitcoin is an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.</P>

                    <p>Bitcoin trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in Bitcoin because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling. </p>

                    <p>Our business model, and our Service, consists of facilitating the buying, selling and trading of Bitcoins and their use to purchase/exchange goods in an unregulated, international open payment system. </p>

                    <p>Localcoinbox reserves the right to change, add or remove portions of these Terms, at any time, in an exercise of its sole discretion. You will be notified of any changes in advance through your Account. Upon such notification, it is your responsibility to review the amended Terms. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of a notice of changes to the Terms signifies that you accept and agree to the changes, and that all subsequent transactions by you will be subject to the amended Terms. </p>

                    <p>If you have any questions relating to these Terms of Use, your rights and obligations arising from these Terms and/or your use of the Site and the Service, your Account, or any other matter, please contact info@localcoinbox.com . </p>
